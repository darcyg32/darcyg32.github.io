Software Engineer Intern
Edgible · Internship
Jul 2024 - Oct 2024 · 4 mos
Adelaide, South Australia, Australia · Hybrid
I had the opportunity to join Edgible as their first intern, contributing directly to a fast-paced, innovative startup environment. Over the course of my internship, I developed a groundbreaking project that integrated tool injection with Ollama and FastAPI—a novel technology combination that, as far as I know, hadn't been implemented and published publicly before. This project enabled language models to call external tools and retrieve real-time data, such as GitHub repository information, weather data, and Docker logs, to enhance user responses.
In addition to this, I worked extensively with Docker and Docker Compose, configuring and deploying containers for various applications. I also utilized Google Cloud and automation tools like n8n to set up workflows and improve operational efficiency. Along the way, I gained hands-on experience with REST APIs, building scalable applications. Postman was integral during testing, helping to simulate API requests and ensure reliable communication between services.
As Edgible’s first intern, I had the unique chance to collaborate closely with the founders and team in an open and supportive environment. The skills and experience I gained during this internship were invaluable, and Edgible plans to leverage the tool injection framework I developed across multiple future applications.

Associated with University of Adelaide
Developed a text-based, turn-based Pokémon battle simulator as part of a three-person team, aiming to provide an engaging player-vs-CPU experience. The game features strategic battles, RPG elements, and an adventurous journey to the top of Mount Fuji.
Players select three Pokémon from a diverse list, each with unique attributes (name, type, level, HP, basic attack, special attack, defense). The objective is to defeat 10 progressively challenging enemies on the way to the final landmark.
Key Features:
Landmarks and Checkpoints: Implemented a checkpoint system, where reaching specific milestones activates new landmarks, acting as checkpoints for players. If defeated, players return to the last checkpoint, creating a challenging and strategic gaming experience.
Turn-Based Battling: Designed a turn-based battle system allowing players and CPU opponents to make strategic moves. Players choose from basic attacks, special attacks, defensive moves, and Pokémon swaps, adding depth to the gameplay.
Enemy Scaling: Developed a scaling difficulty for enemies, with each encounter becoming progressively more challenging. Introduced diverse Pokémon types and special attacks, requiring players to adapt their strategies.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implemented multiple classes, including classes for players, computer players, Pokémon, and the user interface. Utilized OOP principles to create a modular and scalable codebase.
Menu and User Interface: Created a user-friendly interface with a menu system for smooth navigation. Ensured a seamless and immersive experience for players throughout their journey.
Technical Environment:
Languages: C++
Collaboration: Worked closely with a team of three to ensure effective communication, code integration, and collaborative problem-solving.
